- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tarveen7 (Tarveen Gill)
- 👩‍💻 I’m a Data Analyst-in-training with a background in Electronics & Communication Engineering and a passion for turning messy data into clear insights.
- 👀 I’m into data wrangling, EDA, machine learning basics, and building clean, interactive dashboards.
- 🌱 Currently leveling up in: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and a bit of NLP with spaCy.
- 💬 Ask me about: cleaning ugly datasets, finding hidden trends, or automating boring stuff with Python.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on analytics projects—especially anything involving real-world data (Netflix, housing, retail, you name it).
- 📫 Reach me at: [LinkedIn]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarveen-gill) or tarveengill7781@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I get weirdly excited about pivot tables and I’ve debugged Excel formulas at 1 a.m. just for fun.
